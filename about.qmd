## The Problem

Insurance companies need to understand which policies are more likely to result in claims so they
can price risk appropriately and focus attention on higher-risk customers. However, in our dataset
only about **6.4%** of policies have a claim, while **93.6%** do not. This strong class imbalance
(about **14.6 : 1**) makes prediction challenging, because a naïve model could achieve high accuracy
by always predicting "no claim" without learning any useful pattern.

## The Data

We work with a dataset of **58,592 insurance policies** and **41 features**, including:

- Policy information (subscription length, policy details)
- Vehicle characteristics (vehicle age, engine specs, safety features)
- Regional information (region codes and region density)
- A binary target variable `claim_status` indicating whether a claim occurred (1) or not (0)

During our initial checks, we confirmed:

- No missing values  
- No duplicate rows  
- Consistent data types across columns  

This allowed us to focus on feature engineering and modeling instead of heavy data cleaning.

## Our Approach

Our main steps were:

1. **Data validation and preparation**  
   - Verified there were no missing values or duplicates  
   - Encoded categorical variables into numeric form suitable for modeling  
   - Created simple engineered features (e.g., grouping ages or combining risk-related information)

2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
   - Measured class imbalance (93.6% no-claim vs 6.4% claim)  
   - Examined distributions of key features such as subscription length and vehicle age  
   - Compared claim rates across regions and other relevant categories  

3. **Handling class imbalance**  
   - Applied **Random Oversampling** to the training set only, so the model could learn from
     enough claim examples while still evaluating on the original, imbalanced test set.

4. **Modeling and evaluation**  
   - Trained a **Random Forest classifier** on the oversampled training data  
   - Evaluated the model on the untouched test data using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
     - ROC-AUC
     - Confusion matrix

## High-Level Findings

- The target variable is heavily imbalanced, but oversampling helps the model recognize claim cases.
- Features like subscription length, vehicle age, and region-related variables are among the most important
  predictors in the Random Forest model.
- The model is able to capture non-random patterns in claim behavior and can serve as a screening tool
  to flag higher-risk policies for closer review.
