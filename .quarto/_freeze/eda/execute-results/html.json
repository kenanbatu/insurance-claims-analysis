This highlights how geography influences risk.\n\n![](images/region_claim_rates.png)\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- Some regions have claim rates above 10%, while others are closer to 4%.  \n- This indicates that where a customer lives is an important factor in claim likelihood.  \n- These regional patterns later align with feature importance results from the Random Forest model.  \n\n---\n\n## Subscription Length and Claim Behavior\n\nSubscription length captures how long a policy has been active. We explore how claim behavior varies\nacross different subscription lengths.\n\n![](images/subscription_length_vs_claim.png)\n\n**What we see:**\n\n- Policies with longer subscription durations tend to have higher observed claim rates.  \n- This makes sense: the longer a policy is active, the more time there is for a claim to occur.  \n\nThis supports the idea that subscription length is not just a timing variable, but a meaningful\nindicator of accumulated risk.\n\n---\n\n## Interactive: Claim Rates by Region\n\nThe plot below is an interactive visualization of claim behavior by region. Each point represents\na region, with:\n\n- **X-axis:** number of policies  \n- **Y-axis:** claim rate (percentage)  \n- **Point size:** number of policies  \n- **Color:** claim percentage  \n\nHover over points to see more detailed information for each region.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"insurance_claims.csv\")\n\nregion_summary = df.groupby('region_code').agg({\n    'claim_status': ['mean', 'count'],\n    'customer_age': 'mean',\n    'region_density': 'first'\n}).reset_index()\n\nregion_summary.columns = ['region', 'claim_rate', 'policies', 'avg_age', 'density']\nregion_summary['claim_pct'] = region_summary['claim_rate'] * 100\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    region_summary,\n    x='policies',\n    y='claim_pct',\n    size='policies',\n    color='claim_pct',\n    hover_name='region',\n    hover_data={'policies':':,', 'claim_pct':':.2f', 'avg_age':':.1f'},\n    title='Interactive: Claim Rates by Region',\n    color_continuous_scale='Reds',\n    size_max=30,\n    height=500\n)\n\nfig\n\n",
