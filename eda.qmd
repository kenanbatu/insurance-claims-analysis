## Distributions of Key Numerical Features

We begin our exploratory data analysis by looking at the distributions of three important
numerical variables:

- **Customer age**
- **Vehicle age**
- **Subscription length**

These histograms help us understand the spread and central tendencies of key features that
later play a role in the model.

**What we observe:**

- Customer ages are mostly concentrated in a working-age range.  
- Vehicle age is skewed toward newer cars.  
- Subscription length varies widely and later appears as a strong predictor.

## Claim Rates Across Categories

This visualization compares claim rates across:

- **Fuel type**  
- **Region density**  
- **Vehicle segment**

**Insights:**

- Some fuel types show slightly higher claim risk.  
- Claim rates increase in higher-density regions.  
- Certain vehicle segments consistently have higher claim frequencies.

## Regional Claim Differences

We also examine geographic variation in claims.

**Interpretation:**

- Claim behavior varies meaningfully across regions.  
- Some regions exceed 10% claim rate while others sit closer to 4%.  
- Geography is therefore an important predictor in our model.

## Subscription Length and Claim Behavior

**We observe:**

- Longer subscription durations correlate with higher claim rates.  
- This reflects accumulated exposure time and helps explain why subscription length
  appears as a top feature in the model.

## Interactive: Claim Rates by Region

The visualization below is a fully interactive version of regional claim behavior.
You can hover over points to see:

- Claim rate (percentage)  
- Number of policies in that region  
- Average customer age  
- Population density  

This interactive chart allows a more detailed exploration of geographic patterns.
