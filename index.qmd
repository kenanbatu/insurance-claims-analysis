title: "Insurance Claims Analysis"

## Overview

This website summarizes our group project on predicting the likelihood that an insurance policy
will result in a claim. The dataset contains information about policyholders, their vehicles,
and their regions, along with a binary target variable indicating whether a claim occurred.

Because claims are rare compared to non-claims (only about 6.4% of policies result in a claim),
the data is highly imbalanced. This makes simple accuracy misleading and motivates the need
for careful modeling.

We clean and validate the data, explore key patterns, address the class imbalance using
Random Oversampling, and train a Random Forest classification model to estimate claim risk.

## What You’ll Find Here

- A description of the problem and dataset
- A summary of our data cleaning and validation steps
- Key visualizations illustrating class imbalance and feature patterns
- Model performance results (accuracy, recall, ROC-AUC, and more)
- Business insights on how these results could support insurance decision-making

## Final Model Snapshot

Our final Random Forest model, trained on oversampled data and evaluated on the original
test set, achieves:

- **Accuracy:** 63.4%  
- **Recall:** 59.3%  
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.66  

These results show that the model can identify a majority of true claims while working
with a challenging, highly imbalanced dataset.
